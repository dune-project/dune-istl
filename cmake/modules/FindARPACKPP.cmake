#    Variables used by this module which you may want to set:
#
#    :ref:`ARPACKPP_ROOT`
#       Path list to search for ARPACK++.
#
#    Sets the following variables:
#
#    :code:`ARPACKPP_FOUND`
#       True if ARPACK++ available.
#
#    :code:`ARPACKPP_INCLUDE_DIRS`
#       Path to the ARPACK++ include directories.
#
#    :code:`ARPACKPP_LIBRARIES`
#       Link against these libraries to use ARPACK++.
#
# .. cmake_variable:: ARPACKPP_ROOT
#
#    You may set this variable to have :ref:`FindARPACKPP` look
#    for the ARPACKPP package in the given path before inspecting
#    system paths.
