       A solver solves a linear operator equation A(x)=b by applying
       one or several steps of the preconditioner. The method pre()
       is called before the first apply operation.
       b and x are right hand side and solution vector of the linear
       system respectively. It may. e.g., scale the system, allocate memory or
       compute a (I)LU decomposition.
       Note: The ILU decomposition could also be computed in the constructor
       or with a separate method of the derived method if several
       linear systems with the same matrix are to be solved.

       \note if a preconditioner is copied (e.g. for a second thread)
       again the pre() method has to be called to ensure proper memory
       mangement.
